# goBarber Front-end

goBarber is an application where barbers can offer their services to the public and clients can schedule appoints with their favorite barbers.

This repository contains the application's Front-end and was developed during the Rocketseat's MERN stack Bootcamp.

# Technologies and Learning Outcomes

The back-end was developed with **React** and **Typescript**. It allowed me to have hands on experience with:

- RESTful APIs
- Routing
- Styled Components
- Props
- Forms (unForm)
- Hooks
- Context API
- Storage
- Authentication with JWT
- Exception Handling
- Calendars
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Application Deployment (Netlify and Google Cloud)

# Installation

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's folder and run

```

If you wish to fully play with the application, you will also have to download the [Back-end](https://github.com/feernandobraga/goBarber-back-end)

With the back-end running, make sure that you are at the root folder of the project and run:
